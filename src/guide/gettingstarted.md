# Getting Started
1. Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install @Vue/cli 4 [globally](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
3. Clone repo
4. Navigate to the folder you cloned the repo to
5. Open your terminal(CMD/Power Shell etc) to project root( or use Shift + right-click in the folder on windows)
6. At project root (/M-Dash) run one of the following commands in the terminal depending on which you use:
     - `npm install`, or `yarn install` (if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) )
7. Run `npm run dev --open` or `yarn serve --open` to start a local development server 
    - or use [`Vue UI`](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#using-the-gui)
8. A new tab will be opened in your browser or click the url in the terminal
9. You can use [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) to test logging in/out & data tables api
    - otherwise use your own backend or a package like [Json Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) or [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
  
##### After, you can also run additional tasks such as:
to build your app for production: `npm/yarn run build ` 

To run linting: `npm/yarn run lint`
