Formerly known by Vuetify Admin Dashboard

M-Dashboard is a simple (Hopefully not ugly) productivity Dashboard to monitor tasks/work, it can also be used as an crud admin panel.
Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, and the below libraries (Really just the first four)

### Built with

#### [Vue 2.x](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

#### [Vuetify 2.x ](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
is a Vue UI library that allows you to quickly develop designs according to Material Design spec.

#### [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/)
allows you to build routes/paths and handle the single page app routing.

#### [Vuex3.x](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html)
is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components.

#### [Vue CLI 4.x](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
handles a lot of the set up and boilerplate also configures webpack and more 

#### Axios
Handles making requests and custom instances for different urls

#### Apex charts
charts
#### Sentry
error monitoring



### Few things on the roadmap

- pro version(if I get to it)
- this will always be free
