Formerly known by Vuetify Admin Dashboard

M-Dashboard is a simple (Hopefully not ugly) productivity Dashboard to monitor tasks/work, it can also be used as an crud admin panel.
Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, and the below libraries (Really just the first four)

### Built with

#### [Vue 2.x](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

#### [Vuetify 2.x ](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
is a Vue UI library that allows you to quickly develop designs according to Material Design spec.

#### [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/)
allows you to build routes/paths and handle the single page app routing.

#### [Vuex3.x](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html)
is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components.

#### [Vue CLI 4.x](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
handles a lot of the set up and boilerplate also configures webpack and more 

#### Axios
Handles making requests and custom instances for different urls

#### Apex charts
charts
#### Sentry
error monitoring



### Few things on the roadmap
- user roles
- user page api's
- more prepackaged components
- pro version(if I get to it)
- this will always be free
- more features and support
- dynamic inline edit 
- Cool new login screen


#### [Old version 1.0 Demo](https://clintoxx.github.io/M-Dashboard-Materialfy/)


## Getting Started
- Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install @Vue/cli 4 [globally](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
- clone repo
-  & navigate to the folder you cloned the repo to
- Open your terminal(CMD/Power Shell etc) to project root( or use Shift + right-click in the folder on windows)
- at project root (/M-Dashboard) run one of the following commands in the terminal depending on which you use:
  - `npm install`, or `yarn install`if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) 
- Run `npm run dev --open` or `yarn serve --open` to start a local development server or use [Vue UI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#using-the-gui)
- A new tab will be opened in your browser or click the url in the terminal
- You can use [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) to test logging in/out, or for data tables api(its already hooked up)
  - otherwise use your own backend or a package like [Json Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) or [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

After installing the dependencies you can also run additional tasks such as these fun ones:
- `npm/yarn run build` to build your app for production
- `npm/yarn run lint` to run linting.
